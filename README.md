# Pabadora_C-Personal_Website
Midterm Project - Personal Website

I only use one HTML, but I separate the styles of each category/section that I have.
In CSS I research from w3school and use of Copilot and personal tweaks in order to achieve the style of my HTML/Website.

I try my best to copy what I did on Figma, but in the end I only use one page for my tabs/categories (about, photography, cinematography, films and documentaries, and contacts)
